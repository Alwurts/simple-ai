## About

The Chat Suggestions component provides a composable way to display prompt suggestions to users in your chat interface. Following the shadcn/ui design philosophy, it's built with small, reusable pieces that can be composed together to create flexible layouts.

Perfect for onboarding new users, suggesting common queries, or providing quick actions in empty chat states.

## Usage

```tsx
import {
  ChatSuggestion,
  ChatSuggestions,
  ChatSuggestionsContent,
  ChatSuggestionsDescription,
  ChatSuggestionsHeader,
  ChatSuggestionsTitle,
} from "@/components/ui/chat-suggestions"
```

### Basic Usage

```tsx
<ChatSuggestions>
  <ChatSuggestionsTitle>Try these prompts:</ChatSuggestionsTitle>
  <ChatSuggestionsContent>
    <ChatSuggestion onClick={() => console.log("What can you help me with?")}>
      What can you help me with?
    </ChatSuggestion>
    <ChatSuggestion onClick={() => console.log("Show me examples")}>
      Show me examples
    </ChatSuggestion>
  </ChatSuggestionsContent>
</ChatSuggestions>
```

### With Header and Description

```tsx
<ChatSuggestions>
  <ChatSuggestionsHeader>
    <ChatSuggestionsTitle>Quick start</ChatSuggestionsTitle>
    <ChatSuggestionsDescription>
      Click a suggestion to get started
    </ChatSuggestionsDescription>
  </ChatSuggestionsHeader>
  <ChatSuggestionsContent>

# AI Agents

Pre-built AI agents with tools and prompts. Copy and paste into your apps. Open Source.

## Installation

Copy complete agents into your project using the shadcn CLI:

```bash
# Install all agents
npx shadcn@latest add @simple-ai/agents

# Or install specific agents
npx shadcn@latest add @simple-ai/weather-agent
npx shadcn@latest add @simple-ai/search-agent
```

## Live Examples

Before diving into the details, check out the [Agents Gallery](/agents) where you can:

- **See all available agents** with their descriptions and tools
- **Chat directly with agents** to see them in action
- **View agent source code** to understand implementation details
- **Copy agents directly** into your project with the shadcn CLI

This is the best way to understand what's possible with the agent system!

## How It Works

### Agent Structure

Every agent consists of three key components:

```typescript
// 1. Agent Definition
export const weatherAgent = new Agent({
  model: model.languageModel("gpt-5.1"),
  tools: {
    "get-weather": getWeatherTool,
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(20),
});

// 2. System Prompt
export const weatherAgentPrompt = `You are a helpful weather assistant...`;

// 3. Tool Implementation
export const getWeatherTool = tool({
  description: "Get weather information for a location",
  parameters: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe("The location to get weather for"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ location }) => {
    // Implementation here
  },
});
```

### Available Agents

#### Weather Agent (`@simple-ai/weather-agent`)

A helpful weather assistant that provides accurate weather information for any location.

**Features:**
- Current weather conditions
- Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit
- Location-based queries
- Real-time weather data

**System Prompt:** "You are a helpful weather assistant. Your role is to provide accurate and helpful weather information to users..."

#### Search Agent (`@simple-ai/search-agent`)

An intelligent search assistant that finds information from the web and provides up-to-date results.

**Features:**
- Web search capabilities
- Information synthesis
- Question answering
- Current events and news

**System Prompt:** "You are a helpful search assistant. Your role is to find and provide accurate information from the web..."

### Agent Execution Flow

Agents work using the Vercel AI SDK's experimental Agent API:

1. **User sends a message** via the chat interface
2. **Frontend sends the message** along with the agent ID using the `useChat` hook
3. **Backend routes to the appropriate agent** based on the agent ID
4. **Agent processes the request** using multi-step reasoning and tool calling:
   - Agent analyzes the user query
   - Agent decides which tools to use (if any)
   - Agent calls tools and processes results
   - Agent formulates a response based on tool outputs
   - Agent streams the response back to the UI
5. **Real-time responses** stream back to the chat interface

### Tool Integration

Agents can use tools to enhance their capabilities:

```typescript
// Example tool definition
export const getWeatherTool = tool({
  description: "Get weather information for a location",
  parameters: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe("The location to get weather for"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ location }) => {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.weather.com/${location}`);
    return await response.json();
  },
});
```

Tools are automatically called by the agent when needed, and their results are integrated into the agent's reasoning and response.

## Creating Custom Agents

### Basic Agent Structure

To create your own agent:

1. **Define the Agent** with model, tools, and stopping conditions
2. **Create a System Prompt** that defines the agent's role and behavior
3. **Implement Tools** for specific capabilities your agent needs

### Example: Custom Email Agent

```typescript
// email-agent.ts
import { Experimental_Agent as Agent, stepCountIs } from "ai";
import { model } from "@/registry/ai/models";

export const emailAgentPrompt = `You are a helpful email assistant...`;

export const emailAgent = new Agent({
  model: model.languageModel("gpt-5.1"),
  tools: {
    "send-email": sendEmailTool,
    "read-emails": readEmailsTool,
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(15),
});
```

### Best Practices

- **Clear System Prompts**: Define the agent's role, capabilities, and limitations clearly
- **Focused Tools**: Give agents only the tools they need for their specific tasks
- **Appropriate Step Limits**: Set reasonable step limits to prevent infinite loops
- **Error Handling**: Tools should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback

## Integration Examples

### Using Agents in Your App

```typescript
// In your chat component
import { useChat } from "@ai-sdk/react";
import { DefaultChatTransport } from "ai";

function ChatComponent() {
  const { messages, sendMessage, status } = useChat({
    id: "my-chat",
    transport: new DefaultChatTransport({
      api: "/api/chat", // Your API endpoint
    }),
  });

  // Send message with agent context
  const handleSend = (message: string, agentId: string) => {
    sendMessage(message, {
      body: {
        agentId, // Route to specific agent
      },
    });
  };

  return (
    // Your chat UI
  );
}
```

### Backend API Route

```typescript
// app/api/chat/route.ts
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { streamText } from "ai";
import { weatherAgent } from "@/lib/agents/weather-agent";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages, agentId } = await req.json();

  // Route to appropriate agent
  const agent = getAgentById(agentId);

  const result = await streamText({
    model: openai("gpt-4"),
    messages,
    experimental_providerMetadata: {
      agent,
    },
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

## Extending Agents

### Adding New Tools

Tools extend agent capabilities:

```typescript
import { tool } from "ai";
import { z } from "zod";

export const customTool = tool({
  description: "A custom tool for your agent",
  parameters: z.object({
    input: z.string().describe("The input parameter"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ input }) => {
    // Your tool logic here
    return { result: "Processed: " + input };
  },
});
```

### Custom Agent Registry

```typescript
// agents.ts
export const agents = {
  "weather-agent": weatherAgent,
  "search-agent": searchAgent,
  "custom-agent": customAgent, // Your new agent
} as const;

export type AgentId = keyof typeof agents;
```

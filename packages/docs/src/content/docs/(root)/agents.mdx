# AI Agents Guide

Build multi-agent chat applications with pre-built AI agents. This guide walks you through creating your first project and adding agent capabilities.

> This system is built on top of the **Vercel AI SDK Agents**. For deep dives into agent concepts, check out their [official documentation](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/agents/overview).


## 1. Add Multi-Agent Chat

The foundation of the agent system is the `chat-04` block. This component handles the UI, agent routing, and real-time streaming.

Install it using the CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @simple-ai/chat-04
```

This adds the multi-agent chat interface where users can interact with different agents in a single conversation.

## 2. Install Agents

Now that you have the chat interface, you can install specific agents from the registry. Each agent adds new capabilities to your application.

### Weather Agent
Adds weather forecasting capabilities.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @simple-ai/weather-agent
```

## 3. Import the agents

Import the agents into your agent and tool registry files at `lib/ai/agents/agents-registry.ts` and `lib/ai/tools/tools-registry.ts`.

## How It Works

Once installed, agents are automatically available in your chat.
1.  **Install** the agent using the CLI.
2.  **Import** and add it to your agent and tool configuration (usually in `lib/ai/agents/agents-registry.ts` and `lib/ai/tools/tools-registry.ts`).
3.  **Chat** with the agent by mentioning it (e.g., "@weather-agent") or just asking a question if it's the default.

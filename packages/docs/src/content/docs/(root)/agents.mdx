# AI Agents Guide

Build multi-agent chat applications with pre-built AI agents. This guide walks you through creating your first project and adding agent capabilities.

> This system is built on top of the **Vercel AI SDK Agents**. For deep dives into agent concepts, check out their [official documentation](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/agents/overview).

## 1. Create Your Project

If you don't have a project yet, start by creating one with `create-simple-ai`:

```bash
npx create-simple-ai my-ai-app
cd my-ai-app
npm run dev
```

This sets up a full-stack Next.js application with everything you need.

## 2. Add Multi-Agent Chat

The foundation of the agent system is the `chat-04` block. This component handles the UI, agent routing, and real-time streaming.

Install it using the CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @simple-ai/chat-04
```

This adds the multi-agent chat interface where users can interact with different agents in a single conversation.

## 3. Install Agents

Now that you have the chat interface, you can install specific agents from the registry. Each agent adds new capabilities to your application.

### Weather Agent
Adds weather forecasting capabilities.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @simple-ai/weather-agent
```

### Search Agent
Adds web search capabilities.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @simple-ai/search-agent
```

## How It Works

Once installed, agents are automatically available in your chat.
1.  **Install** the agent using the CLI.
2.  **Import** and add it to your agent configuration (usually in `app/api/chat/route.ts` or similar, depending on your setup).
3.  **Chat** with the agent by mentioning it (e.g., "@weather-agent") or just asking a question if it's the default.

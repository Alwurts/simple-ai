# AI Agents Guide

Build multi-agent chat applications with pre-built AI agents. This guide walks you through creating your first project and adding agent capabilities.

## 1. Create Your Project

If you don't have a project yet, start by creating one with `create-simple-ai`:

```bash
npx create-simple-ai my-ai-app
cd my-ai-app
npm run dev
```

This sets up a full-stack Next.js application with:
- ✅ Next.js with App Router
- ✅ Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Drizzle ORM for database
- ✅ Better Auth for authentication
- ✅ Hono for API routes
- ✅ Ready-to-use chat foundation

## 2. Add Multi-Agent Chat

Install the chat-04 block to set up the basic multi-agent chat interface:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @simple-ai/chat-04
```

This adds:
- 🤖 **Multi-agent chat interface** - Chat with multiple AI agents
- 🎯 **Agent routing** - Automatically route messages to the right agent
- 💬 **Real-time streaming** - Live responses from agents
- 🏗️ **Modular layout** - Header, sidebar, and chat components

The chat-04 block includes everything you need for multi-agent conversations out of the box.

## 3. Install Agents from Registry

Once you have your chat setup, install agents from the registry to add specific capabilities:

```bash
# Install weather agent
npx shadcn@latest add @simple-ai/weather-agent

# Install search agent
npx shadcn@latest add @simple-ai/search-agent
```

### Available Agents

**Weather Agent** (`@simple-ai/weather-agent`)
- Get current weather conditions for any location
- Supports temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit
- Real-time weather data and forecasts

**Search Agent** (`@simple-ai/search-agent`)
- Intelligent web search capabilities
- Find information from the internet
- Answer questions with up-to-date results
- Current events and news

### Try Agents Live

Visit the [Agents Gallery](/agents) to:
- **Chat directly with agents** to see them in action
- **View agent source code** to understand implementation
- **Copy agents directly** into your project

## How It Works

When you chat with an agent:

1. **You mention an agent** in your message (like "@weather-agent")
2. **The system routes** your message to the appropriate agent
3. **The agent thinks** about your request and decides what to do
4. **Tools are called** automatically (like fetching weather data)
5. **Response streams back** in real-time to your chat

Agents combine AI reasoning with practical tools to give you helpful, accurate answers.

## Creating Custom Agents

Want to build your own agent? Start with the existing agent implementations in the registry as templates:

```bash
# Copy an existing agent as a starting point
npx shadcn@latest add @simple-ai/weather-agent
```

Then modify the agent definition, system prompt, and tools to fit your needs. Check out the [Technical Reference](#technical-reference) below for implementation details.

## Technical Reference

### Agent Structure

Each agent consists of:

```typescript
// Agent Definition
export const myAgent = new Agent({
  model: model.languageModel("gpt-4"),
  tools: { "my-tool": myTool },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(20),
});

// System Prompt
export const myAgentPrompt = `You are a helpful assistant...`;

// Tool Implementation
export const myTool = tool({
  description: "Tool description",
  parameters: z.object({ input: z.string() }),
  execute: async ({ input }) => { /* logic */ },
});
```

### Agent Execution Flow

1. User mentions agent in message
2. System routes to appropriate agent
3. Agent analyzes query and decides on tools
4. Tools execute and return data
5. Agent formulates response with tool results
6. Response streams back to UI

### API Integration

The chat-04 block handles all the complex routing and streaming automatically. Your API route simply needs to handle the agent execution:

```typescript
// app/api/chat/route.ts
import { agentExecute, agentRoute } from "@/lib/ai/agent-route-respond";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages, mentions } = await req.json();
  const agentId = agentRoute(mentions);
  return agentExecute(agentId, messages);
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Clear system prompts**: Define agent roles and limitations
- **Focused tools**: Give agents only necessary tools
- **Reasonable step limits**: Prevent infinite loops
- **Error handling**: Tools should handle failures gracefully

description: Get started building beautiful, accessible, and performant chat interfaces with simple-ai components.

## Why simple-ai?

* **Chat-First Design** - Components specifically designed for chat and conversational interfaces
* **Modern UX Patterns** - Implements patterns seen in leading AI chat applications
* **Copy and Paste** - Use components directly in your app and customize them to your needs
* **TypeScript** - Written in TypeScript for better developer experience

## Vercel AI SDK Compatibility

The components in simple-ai are designed to work seamlessly with [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/). If you're building AI-powered applications with Vercel's SDK, our components provide the perfect UI layer for your chat interfaces, handling streaming responses, loading states, and complex chat interactions out of the box.

## Philosophy

simple-ai follows the same philosophy as [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com): giving you ownership and control over the code. We believe that:

1. You should have complete control over your chat interface components
2. Components should be easy to customize and extend
4. Chat interfaces should be performant, even with large message histories

## Credits

This project wouldn't be possible without [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). It serves as the main inspiration for both the philosophy and implementation approach of this collection. We also draw inspiration from the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) for our chat-specific components and interactions.

## FAQ

<Accordion type="multiple">

<AccordionItem value="faq-1">
	<AccordionTrigger>
		Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?
	</AccordionTrigger>
	<AccordionContent>
The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled.

Start with some sensible defaults, then customize the components to your needs.

This approach allows you to maintain full control over your chat interface implementation while starting with battle-tested components.

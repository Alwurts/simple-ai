      How does Simple AI differ from shadcn/ui?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      <p>
        Simple AI is built on top of shadcn/ui but adds AI-specific components,
        app blocks, and integrations that shadcn/ui doesn't include. While
        shadcn/ui focuses on general-purpose UI components, Simple AI provides
        the building blocks specifically for AI-powered applications.

      Can I use Simple AI components in non-AI applications?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      <p>
        Absolutely! The components are built with the same principles as
        shadcn/ui - they're highly customizable and can be used in any
        application. The chat components work great for customer support
        interfaces, collaborative tools, or any messaging application.

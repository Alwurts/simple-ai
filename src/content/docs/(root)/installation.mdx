## Prerequisites

simple-ai is built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), so you'll need to set it up first:

1. Follow the [shadcn/ui installation guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) to set up shadcn/ui in your project
2. Install the base components you need from shadcn/ui using their CLI
3. Get familiar with how shadcn/ui works - our components follow the same philosophy

## Installing Components

Once you have shadcn/ui set up, you can start adding simple-ai components to your project. Each component page in our documentation includes a command you can run to add it to your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://simple-ai.dev/r/chat-message.json
```

This will:
1. Copy the component to your project
2. Add all required npm dependencies
3. Add any required shadcn/ui components that the component depends on

# React Flow Components for AI Workflows

Our React Flow components provide a powerful foundation for building interactive AI agent workflows. Inspired by [React Flow's component library](https://reactflow.dev/components) and enhanced with AI capabilities through the Vercel AI SDK, these components enable you to create sophisticated AI workflows through a visual, drag-and-drop interface.

## Overview

We've built a suite of specialized React Flow components designed specifically for AI workflows:
- **AI Ready Nodes**: Pre-built nodes for text generation, prompt crafting, and more
- **Custom Edges**: Smart connections with built-in state management
- **Interactive Handles**: Editable connection points for dynamic workflow configuration

## Key Features

- ðŸ”Œ **Vercel AI SDK Integration**: Built-in support for streaming responses and state management
- ðŸŽ¨ **shadcn/ui Styling**: Beautiful, consistent design using Tailwind CSS
- ðŸ“¦ **Copy-Paste Ready**: Install components directly using the shadcn CLI
- ðŸ”„ **Real-time Updates**: Live preview of AI agent interactions
- ðŸŽ® **Interactive Design**: Drag-and-drop interface for building workflows

## The tech stack

Our React Flow components are built on top of:
- [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev) for the core diagram functionality
- [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) for AI capabilities
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for consistent styling

## AI Agent Examples

We provide complete examples of AI agent workflows inspired by [Anthropic's article on building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents). Visit our [AI Agents page](/ai-agents) to explore:

- **Chain Workflow**: Multi-step content creation with quality checks and content transformation pipelines
- **Routing Workflow**: Directs incoming requests to specialized processes based on content type
- **Parallelization Workflow**: Handles multiple tasks simultaneously with optional result aggregation
- **Orchestrator-Workers Workflow**: Uses a coordinator to distribute tasks to specialists based on requirements

Each example is fully functional and can be copied directly into your project using the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://simple-ai.dev/r/flow-chain.json
```
